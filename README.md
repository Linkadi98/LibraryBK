<h2> First Project at Ha Noi University of Science and Technology </h2> 

<p> To use my code like an example, please follow exactly below: </p>
<p> # You must have MySQL or MSSQL to run the script I put inside, in order to create database </p1>
(But you can use another one, just depend on your habit)
<p> # You must use Netbeans 9.0 to connect to MySQL 8.0 if you use this one. But, like I said before, you can use another one if you don't like Netbeans </p> 
<p># My code is very long because I am working on my first Project so it seems like I still don't have enough experiences to format my code 
to use easily </p>

The last one, if you don't have much time with Java Swing or simply with Java core, it's very difficult to read the code, so my suggestion is you should learn step by step to get a good knowlegde about Java to follow my project

I am just newbie like every third-year student at college so I am very appreciate if you use my code and let me know what mistakes I've done

Thank you!
